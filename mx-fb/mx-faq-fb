Styles
Styles are simple text files that tell fluxbox how to generate the appearance of different components of the window manager. Fluxbox ships with a large number, and many more can be found online with a web search on "fluxbox styles." They include a background image, but that is blocked in MXfb by a line in ~/.fluxbox/overlay. To allow the style to determine the background, place a hash mark in front to the line so that it looks like this:
----------
! The following line will prevent styles from setting the background.
#background: none
----------

Backgrounds
Backgrounds will be determined by the style selected unless the blocked by the overlay file (default).
The list that pops up from the menu entry includes user backgrounds (~/.fluxbox/backgrounds) and system backgrounds (/usr/share/backgrounds), separated by a horizontal line. This setup allows you to put your preferred backgrounds in the user folder and be able to select among the group with a simple click.

Keystrokes 
Many listed by default in ~/.fluxbox/keys, though not all of them work by default.
Mod1 = Alt
Mod4 = Logo key (Windows, Apple)
Control = Control
Shift = Shift

Apps
When an app is open, you can right-click the title bar and set any of the options available. For instance, you can select to remember workspace, size, etc. Your choices are recorded in ~/.fluxbox/apps.
--Communicate > Video: for that to work Skype needs to be installed

Misc
To adjust brightness, right-click the battery icon in the systray
